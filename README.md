# Array Processing Application

## Overview
This project is a GUI-based application for working with two-dimensional and one-dimensional arrays. The program allows users to create a matrix, fill it with values using three different methods, generate a vector based on predefined conditions, and compute a numerical function from the vector. The application includes a menu for executing the described operations, displaying results, and exiting the program.

## Features
- User-defined matrix dimensions.
- Three matrix initialization methods:
  - Manual input.
  - Random values (-9 to 9).
  - Formula-based calculation.
- Automatic vector creation from the matrix based on conditions.
- Computation of a numerical function based on the vector.
- Results display within the application.
- Menu with information about the author and project variant.
- Option to save results to a text file.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C#**
- GUI Framework: **Windows Forms** (WinForms)
- **Random** Number Generation
- **Mathematical Computations**
- **File Handling**

## Usage
1. Set matrix dimensions.
2. Choose a filling method (manual, random, or formula-based).
3. Generate a vector based on the defined algorithm.
4. Compute the numerical function.
5. View and save results.
6. Exit the application through the menu.
